# HANGMAN

You will be creating the popular game of Hangman as a JavaScript console game!

Make sure you break the problem down and timebox. You are encouraged to base your solution on the functions/objects below (You don't have to write the objects/functions in order , but make a plan on how to tackle this project in small steps and commit often)

**Note:** It is encouraged that you follow the basic structure/recommended functions below. But if you work out a different solution to acomplish game play that's ok! Roll with it!

## words
An array called `words` containing words to be guessed. Start simple by just having your player guess a single word. Later on, you can refactor your code so that your player is guessing phrases. But for now keep it simple

## chooseWord()
A function that returns a random word from the word array

## game 
An object literal that has the following attributes

* `guesses`
  * a number
* `guessedLetters`
  * an array of strings
* `isOver()`
  * a function that checks whether to play another round, depending if the game is won, the game is lost, or the game can still be played (not won and still less than 10 guesses)
   Suggested functionality:
   * returns true if the word is fully guessed : run the function `isFound()` (see `Word` constructor function )
   * returns true if the number of guesses is 0
   * returns false if the game should still be in play
* `overMessage()`
  * returns "You win", if the word is completely guessed
  * returns "You lose", if `guesses` is 0
 

## Letter()

Letter is a class. In order to play Hangman, you will need information about each letter - what is its value? Is it hidden? You will also need a way to change its state (from hidden to not hidden), depending if the player has guessed the letter. 

#### Object Attributes

* `value`
  * a string
* `hidden`
  * a boolean ( should be set to true by default )
* `show()`
  * a function that will set `hidden` to false
* `display()`
  * a function that will return ` _ ` if the letter is hidden and return the value if the letter is not hidden

## Word()

Letter is a constructor function(ES5) or class(ES6). This constructor has a function to generate the Letter objects called `getLetters` and stores each letter as an object inside an array called `letters`.

#### Object Attributes

* `letters`
  * an array of Letter objects
* `getLetters(newWord)`
  * accepts an input argument, a string. It will split the string into `Letter` objects and push them into the `letters` array
* `isFound()`
  * if true, call `overMessage()` (from `game` object)  and return true if no letters are still hidden
  * returns false if at least one letter is hidden
* `test(letter)`
 * accepts an input argument, a string goes through the Letters in the letter array and updates the `.hidden` value on the ones whose value matches the input argument `letter` and returns a boolean indicating if the letter was found
* `render()`
  * returns the word in its "guessed state"
  * ex: for the word 'closure', if the letters l, s, and e have been guessed, this function should return the string `_ l _ s _ _ e`



## More `game` Attributes
You may find writing these functions inside the `game` object very challenging at first. Create them as global, get them working and as a stretch, refactor your code so these functions are inside the `game` object

## startGame()
startGame is a funciton <br>
 Suggested functionality:
  * set `guesses` to ten
  * reset the `guessedLetters` array
  * select a random word from `words` using the `chooseWord()` function and set it to a variable named `currentWord`
  * create a `new Word`, set it to a a variable named `currentGame`
  * call `currentGame.getLetters(currentWord)` to set up the `currentGame.letters` array. It should be an array of `Letters` objects
  * call playGame() once 
  
## playGame()
playGame is a function<br>
Suggested functionality: 
 * using the `game.isOver()` function, check if another round should be played or if the game is over 
  * use if/if else/else to decide what should happen
 * If the game is not over:
  * prompt the player to enter a letter
  `test(letter)` if `letter` hasn't been tried already. Push the `letter` tried into the array of `guessedLetters`
  * decrease the guess count each round 
  * check if the game is over `game.isOver()`
   * if `true` call overMessage()
   * if `false` call playGame() **caution** this may cause an infinite loop without the correct logic





## Hungry for More (choose any)

* After the game is over, give the user the option to either quit or start a new game, and implement the necessary code for this feature to work
* Hook it up to the DOM
* Improve user experience - allow users to enter upperletters or lowercase letters, let a user know they entered an invalid character (number, symbol), let a user know they entered more than one character, add more informative prompts/alerts and more!
* Switch from prompt/alert in the browser to an input field  and display the game progress in the browser (render guessed word, show played letters, number of guesses left). We will be covering how to do this in class next week. But if you are excited to research and implement this on your own- go for it!
* Implement ascii graphic which shows more of a hangman for each wrong guess [hint hint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ascii-art) :
```
