# Tomagotchi Mini-Project

### Description

Let's use our front-end web development skills to create a "living" pet! We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery to interact with our pet.

### Requirements

* Create a repo for your tomagotchi pet
* make a commit after you finish each one of the following
* Create a Class (JS Class, look at your notes if your forget) for your tomagotchi
* Instatiate your Tomagotchi
* Display a character of your choice on the screen to represent your pet
* Display the following metrics for your pet: (in chrome console)
 * Hunger (1-10 scale)
 * Sleepiness (1-10 scale)
 * Boredom (1-10 scale)
 * Age
* Add functions to the screen to feed your pet, turn off the lights, and play with your pet.
    (i.e. be able to call `feed()` in chrome console and then log the pet to see the values change)
* Add the ability to name your pet.
* Style the page.
* Increase your pet's age every x minutes
* Increase your pet's Hunger, Sleepiness, and Bored metrics on an interval of your choosing.
* You pet should die if Hunger, Boredom, or Sleepiness hits 10.
* Morph your pet at certain ages.
* Animate your pet across the screen while it's alive.

### Extras
* Change from the console to the DOM, make  buttons to call the functions and update the view of tomagotchi's stats
* Have your tomagotchi give birth to baby tomagotchi...
* ...with special powers (extend the class)!
* Add an `excercise()` method to your tomagotchi, that affects certain properties
* Add anything you can think of... use your imagination!
